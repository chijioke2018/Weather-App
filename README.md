# Weather-App

This is a basic app meant to showcase the openweathermap api.

By typing in the city and the country, you are able to retrieve information such as if the weather is cloudy, rainy, or sunny.

I first set up an initial view in which I collected the place that the user had wanted to find information about. Second, I used
another view to display the information that was collected from the api.
